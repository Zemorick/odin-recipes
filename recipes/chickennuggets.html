            <ul><h3>Nugget</h3></ul>
            <ul>1 to 1-1/4 pounds chicken breast</ul>
            <ul>1 teaspoon onion powder</ul>
            <ul>1 teaspoon garlic powder</ul>
            <ul>1 teaspoon black pepper</ul>
            <ul>1 teaspoon paprika</ul>
            <ul>1 teaspoon salt</ul>
            <ul>1 teaspoon sugar</ul>
            <ul>1/4 cup cornstarch</ul>
            <ul>1/4 cup water</ul>
            <ul><h3>Breading</h3></ul>
            <ul>1 cup all-purpose flour</ul>
            <ul>2 large eggs</ul>
            <ul>1 cup plain breadcrumbs</ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Place the chicken in the food processor and blend until the chicken is minced. Next, add the spices, cornstarch, and water. Process until combined.</li>
            <li>Using a 1-1/2 tablespoon measure, shape the chicken mixture into a rectangular shape in your hand and place it on a baking tray with parchment paper and freeze in the freezer for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat approximately 3-4 cups of vegetable oil in a frying pan or deep fryer.</li>
            <li>Dredge each nugget in the flour to cover, then into the egg, and finally, coat it in bread crumbs.</li>
            <li>Fry the nuggets in batches, if necessary, in oil for about 6-8 minutes, or until golden brown, flipping halfway through the cooking time, if necessary.</li>
            <li>Remove to a paper towel-lined platter or tray briefly to absorb some of the excess oil before serving.</li>
        </ol>
